 FRP framworks provide a kind of `Observable` that can be manipulatedwithout using
 the previous construction but in a way the events can be inserted along the way.

 Those elements are named `Subjects`. We aslo say that they operate as both an observable and an observer object (they can accept new events).

 The following list of `Subject` is not exhaustive and only present the most used in day to day work.
